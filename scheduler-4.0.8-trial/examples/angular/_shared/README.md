# Bryntum Angular Shared

This is a shared library for Angular examples. It contains wrappers around Bryntum components such as Scheduler, Button, Slider and others so that they behave as genuine Angular components.

The actual components are located in `projects/bryntum-angular-shared/src/lib`. The library also contains assets used by the examples.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the bryntum-angular-shared library and copy assets to `dist` folder. This has to be run once before any of the Angular demos would work.

Note: Be sure that you build the library with this command, otherwise the assets are not copied.
