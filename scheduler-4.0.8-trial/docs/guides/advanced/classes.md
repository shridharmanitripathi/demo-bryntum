#The class system

All Bryntum classes extend a `Base` class which provides services
which the subclasses need and which simplify object creation and configuration.

New classes which participate in the Bryntum ecosystem should use this convention.

##Construction
Subclasses which inherit from `Base` must not implement a `constructor`.

Instead, they _may_ implement a `construct` method which will be called immediately 
upon construction, passed the same parameters as the caller passed to the constructor.

This lifts the restriction that the `this` reference is not available until the `super` call.
Subclasses may perform certain operations upon themselves based upon incoming
configuration information *before* calling `super.construct(config)` and passing
all the parameters upwards.

Note that due to automatic application of configuration by the `Base` class,
it is often not necessary to write a `construct` method at all. Processing
of incoming configuration values should be done in `set propName` functions.

The purpose of a constructor is only to initialize private instance properties
which are not available for configuration, but which are needed for class
operation.

##Configuration
When this `construct` call chain arrives at the `Base` class, the `construct` method
there applies the configuration.

Configuration properties are applied in a very special way.

Some configurations may depend on the presence, and preprocessing by the `setter`
of other configurations.

For example the `set data` property setter of the `Grid` subclass
depends upon the incoming `store` config having been preprocessed and
converted into a `Store` instance and cached to be available.

This *could* be done by writing a constructor which reads the incoming config
object in a very specific order, and applies the configs correctly.

But this approach is complex and brittle, and there are often interwoven
and complex dependencies which may change as the class changes.

The approach taken by the `Base` class is that for each incoming config
property a *temporary* instance property is defined, and the `getter`
of that property will delete that temporary property, read the value
from the incoming configuration object, then set that property which will
then pass through the class author's `setter` to become the true property
value.

Then it returns the value of the property which will come through the class
author's `getter`

In this way, the `construct` function may be almost empty. All initialization
takes place in property `setters` which can rely on the presence of 
whatever configuration properties they need.

During initial configuration, the `isConfiguring` property is set to `true` on the instance
so that setters can tell whether the property is being set at instantiation time or later.

And for each config being set an `initializingPropName` flag is set so that if the setter
ends up calling elsewhere, it can always be determined that it is because of a certain config's initialization.

##Class properties versus configurations
Certain properties that a class may need to use should not be passed
through this mechanism because there is a slight overhead (the benefits
described above far outweigh this in terms of robustness and flexibility).

If for example there is a constant string, for example a CSS class name
to be applied to a DOM element, then either place it in a module-private `const`:

```javascript
import Base from "../Base.js";

const myCssClassName = 'my-css-class';

export default class MyClass extends Base {
    
}
```

or, if it needs to be visible to outside code, place it onto the
prototype:

```javascript
import Base from "../Base.js";

export default class MyClass extends Base {
    
}

MyClass.prototype.myCssClassName = 'my-css-class';
```

If the class needs to initialize per-instance properties for internal use
then set them up in the `construct` method before calling `super.construct(config)`

```javascript
import Base from "../Base.js";

export default class MyClass extends Base {
    construct(config) {
        this.addedRecords = [];
        this.removedRecords = [];
        this.modifiedRecords = [];

        super.construct(config);
    }
}
```
